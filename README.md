# TeachMeSenpai || Hack&Roll2019

# About
A game that introduces gamification to typical physiotherapy, making it fun for patients.
This is made possible by attaching a tracking hardware (for orientation and accelerations) to affected limbs. However for this project, a mobile phone using the Sensor UDP app was used in place of an accelerometer.


# What it does
A game that introduces gamification to typical physiotherapy, making it fun for patients.

# How we built it
Using python3.7 on your computer and the application SensorUDP on your phone

# What we learned
I learned python in 24 hrs and the api of SensorUDP

# How to Install
Download the application SensorUDP in google Playstore :
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubccapstone.sensorUDP&hl=en_SG

Clone the directory from :
https://github.com/xiaoyeong/TeachMeSenpai

Enter the directory by typing in this command
cd Teach-Me-Senpai

Install prerequisite libraries with the following command:
